wfdbcheck
---------

This program is designed to serve as "lint for WFDB": a tool to
automatically find many types of errors that have been known to occur
in WFDB-format signal and annotation files.

These errors range from minor usability problems to severe violations
of the file format.  For example, wfdbcheck will detect:
 - missing signal metadata
 - overflows in signal data
 - undefined signal types
 - problematic filenames
 - inconsistencies between segments of a multi-segment record
 - undefined custom annotation types
 - out-of-range or out-of-order annotations
 - incompatibility with 32-bit WFDB applications

This program can never be comprehensive, but its goal is to help
enforce a set of best practices when preparing a database for
publication, on PhysioNet or elsewhere.

Note that most of the errors reported by this program have actually
occurred at least once in a real-world WFDB record, and as often as
not it was one of *my* programs that was at fault.


Installation
------------

This program requires the WFDB Software Package
(https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml), version 10.6.0 or
later.  After installing WFDB, you can compile and install this
program by running 'make install' in the top-level directory.
